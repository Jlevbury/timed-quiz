# JavaScript Quiz
https://jlevbury.github.io/timed-quiz/

## Description
This weeks challenge was to build from scratch, a timed quiz about JavaScript, using what we have learned so far in Bootcamp about JavaScript. This quiz has a timer that responds to the answer inputs of the user, penalizing 10 seconds of time for a wrong answer. Upon completion of the quiz, the users score is displayed and a user highscore is stored to local storage and displayed for previous attempts. 


## Learning Experience
During the process of completing this script, I found myself having several difficulties in creating the breadcrumb trail of local variables interacting with global variables and incorporation of an event listener. I reached out to askBCS several times during the completion of this assignment, as many of the functions that needed to be implemented were rather complex for a novice user and on multiple occasions the logic of design escaped me. In order to focus on implementing function script, html and CSS elements were kept to a minimum. Overall I had several difficulties in this assignment, much of the process of building this project came from external sources such as youtube, "JavaScript and Jquery by Jon Duckett" and ask BCS
